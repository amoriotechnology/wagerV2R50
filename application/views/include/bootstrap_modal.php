                                <p>For the latest information about developments related to
                                Form W-4, such as legislation enacted after it was published,
                                go to www.irs.gov/FormW4</p>
                                <h4>Purpose of Form</h4>
                                <p>Complete Form W-4 so that your employer can withhold the
                                correct federal income tax from your pay. If too little is
                                withheld, you will generally owe tax when you file your tax
                                return and may owe a penalty. If too much is withheld, you
                                will generally be due a refund. Complete a new Form W-4
                                when changes to your personal or financial situation would
                                change the entries on the form. For more information on
                                withholding and when you must furnish a new Form W-4,
                                see Pub. 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax. </p>
                                <p><strong>Exemption from withholding. </strong>You may claim exemption
                                from withholding for 2022 if you meet both of the following
                                conditions: you had no federal income tax liability in 2021
                                and you expect to have no federal income tax liability in
                                2022. You had no federal income tax liability in 2021 if (1)
                                your total tax on line 24 on your 2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR
                                is zero (or less than the sum of lines 27a, 28, 29, and 30), or
                                (2) you were not required to file a return because your
                                income was below the filing threshold for your correct filing
                                status. If you claim exemption, you will have no income tax
                                withheld from your paycheck and may owe taxes and
                                penalties when you file your 2022 tax return. To claim
                                exemption from withholding, certify that you meet both of
                                the conditions above by writing “Exempt” on Form W-4 in
                                the space below Step 4(c). Then, complete Steps 1(a), 1(b),
                                and 5. Do not complete any other steps. You will need to
                                submit a new Form W-4 by February 15, 2023.</p>
                                <p></strong>Your privacy.</strong> If you prefer to limit information provided in
                                Steps 2 through 4, use the online estimator, which will also
                                increase accuracy.</p>
                                <p>As an alternative to the estimator: if you have concerns
                                with Step 2(c), you may choose Step 2(b); if you have
                                concerns with Step 4(a), you may enter an additional amount
                                you want withheld per pay period in Step 4(c). If this is the
                                only job in your household, you may instead check the box
                                in Step 2(c), which will increase your withholding and
                                significantly reduce your paycheck (often by thousands of
                                dollars over the year).</p>
                                <p><strong>When to use the estimator.</strong> Consider using the estimator at
                                www.irs.gov/W4App if you:</p>
                                <ol>

                                additional taxes, such as Additional Medicare Tax;</li>
                                <li> Have self-employment income (see below); or</li>
                                <li>Prefer the most accurate withholding for multiple job
                                situations</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><strong>Self-employment. </strong>Generally, you will owe both income and
                                self-employment taxes on any self-employment income you
                                receive separate from the wages you receive as an
                                employee. If you want to pay these taxes through
                                withholding from your wages, use the estimator at
                                www.irs.gov/W4App to figure the amount to have withheld.</p>

                                compute your withholding.</p>
                                <p></strong>Step 2.</strong> Use this step if you (1) have more than one job at the
                                same time, or (2) are married filing jointly and you and your
                                spouse both work.</p>
                                <p>Option <b>(a)</b> most accurately calculates the additional tax
                                you need to have withheld, while option <b>(b)</b> does so with a
                                little less accuracy. </p>
                                <p>If you (and your spouse) have a total of only two jobs, you

                                cut in half for each job to calculate withholding. This option
                                is roughly accurate for jobs with similar pay; otherwise, more
                                tax than necessary may be withheld, and this extra amount
                                will be larger the greater the difference in pay is between the

                                one Form W-4. Withholding will be most accurate if
                                you do this on the Form W-4 for the highest paying job.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> This step provides instructions for determining the
                                amount of the child tax credit and the credit for other
                                dependents that you may be able to claim when you file your
                                tax return. To qualify for the child tax credit, the child must
                                be under age 17 as of December 31, must be your
                                dependent who generally lives with you for more than half
                                the year, and must have the required social security number.
                                You may be able to claim a credit for other dependents for
                                whom a child tax credit can’t be claimed, such as an older
                                child or a qualifying relative. For additional eligibility
                                requirements for these credits, see Pub. 501, Dependents,
                                Standard Deduction, and Filing Information. You can also
                                include other tax credits for which you are eligible in this
                                step, such as the foreign tax credit and the education tax
                                credits. To do so, add an estimate of the amount for the year
                                to your credits for dependents and enter the total amount in
                                Step 3. Including these credits will increase your paycheck
                                and reduce the amount of any refund you may receive when
                                you file your tax return.</p>
                                <strong>Step 4 (optional).</strong>
                                <p><strong>Step 4(a).</strong> Enter in this step the total of your other
                                estimated income for the year, if any. You shouldn’t include
                                income from any jobs or self-employment. If you complete
                                Step 4(a), you likely won’t have to make estimated tax
                                payments for that income. If you prefer to pay estimated tax
                                rather than having tax on other income withheld from your
                                paycheck, see Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals.</p>
                                <p></strong>Step 4(b). </strong>Enter in this step the amount from the
                                Deductions Worksheet, line 5, if you expect to claim
                                deductions other than the basic standard deduction on your
                                2022 tax return and want to reduce your withholding to
                                account for these deductions. This includes both itemized
                                deductions and other deductions such as for student loan
                                interest and IRAs</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 4(c). </strong>Enter in this step any additional tax you want
                                withheld from your pay each pay period, including any
                                amounts from the Multiple Jobs Worksheet, line 4. Entering
                                an amount here will reduce your paycheck and will either
                                increase your refund or reduce any amount of tax that you
                                owe</p>
